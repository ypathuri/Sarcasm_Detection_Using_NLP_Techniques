# Sarcasm-Detection_Using_NLP_Techniques
Tweets can be either positive or sarcastic!
For example: If a customer tweets on any e-commerce website "This toaster is amazing, it takes hours to get my toast ready". Here the sarcasm comes to light! Inorder to understand the Irony in either tweets or the sentences, sarcasm detection is helpful.
For our data we have used three main models they are Logistic Regression, n-grams and Universal Sentecnce Encoder (pre-trained model) for our tweet detection.
After using all three models, the conclusion is n-grams has high predicting accuracy of 85% when compared to other two models.
